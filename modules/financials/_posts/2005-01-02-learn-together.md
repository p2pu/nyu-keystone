## (15 mins) Reading: Revenue and Pricing Models

**Web + Mobile Revenue Models:**
* Direct revenue models refer to the primary way a business generates revenue, usually through the sale of its core products or services. For example, a software company's direct revenue model would be the sale of its software product.
    * Advertising: Revenue is generated by displaying ads within the web or mobile app to users. Advertisers pay the web or mobile business for the ad space.
    * Freemium: Revenue is generated by offering a basic version of the web or mobile app for free, while charging users for premium features or services.
    * Virtual goods: Revenue is generated by allowing users to purchase virtual goods or premium features within the app.
    * Subscription: Revenue is generated by charging users a recurring fee for access to the web or mobile app or its premium features.
    * Pay-per-use: Revenue is generated on a per-use basis.
* Ancillary revenue models refer to additional revenue streams that a business can generate outside of its core products or services. These revenue streams can include complementary products, services, or advertising. For example, a software company's ancillary revenue model could include advertising revenue from displaying ads within their software product, or revenue from offering premium customer support services to customers.
    * Referral revenue: Businesses can incentivize customers to refer new customers to their products or services, often with discounts or rewards.
    * Affiliate revenue: Businesses can earn commission by promoting other companies' products or services to their customers. 
    * Data monetization: Businesses can monetize the data they collect from customers by selling it to third-party companies or using it to improve their own products and services, such as through email list rentals.
    * Back-end offers: Businesses can promote add-on sales items from other companies as part of their registration or purchase confirmation processes, or “sell” their existing traffic to a company that strives to monetize it and share the resulting revenue

The key difference between direct and ancillary revenue models is that direct revenue models are the main source of revenue for the business, while ancillary revenue models are additional streams of revenue that support the business's core offerings.

**Physical Revenue Models**
* Asset sale: Revenue is generated by selling a physical or digital asset, such as a product or software license, to a customer for a one-time fee.
* Usage fee: Revenue is generated by charging customers for the amount they use a product or service, such as a pay-per-use model.
    * Ex: FedEx, cellular data plans, and Amazon Web Services
* Subscription fee: Revenue is generated by charging customers a recurring fee for access to a product or service, usually on a monthly or annual basis.
    * Ex: Netflix
* Renting: Revenue is generated by renting out physical or digital assets to customers, such as equipment or software, for a specified period of time.
    * Ex: Chegg
* Licensing: Revenue is generated by granting the right to use a product or service to another party for a fee, such as licensing software to other businesses.
    * Ex: Microsoft Office
* Intermediation fee: Revenue is generated by acting as a middleman between buyers and sellers and charging a fee for facilitating the transaction, such as a commission on sales made through a platform.
    * Ex: Etsy
* Advertising: Revenue is generated by displaying ads to customers, with businesses paying for the ad space or for clicks on the ad.
    * Ex: Google, Facebook

5. Portfolio pricing: Pricing is based on the total value of a bundle of products or services.
6. The "razor/razor blade" model: Pricing is based on selling a primary product at a low price, with the expectation that customers will need to buy complementary products at a higher price.
7. Subscription: Customers pay a recurring fee to access a product or service.
8. Time/Hourly Billing: Pricing is based on the amount of time spent on a project or providing a service.
